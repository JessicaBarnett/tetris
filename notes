identify the widest length and center point: 

pull out all the x values - biggest difference?  get highest/lowest and subtract, then add 1
pull out all the y values - biggest difference? get highest/lowest and subtract, then add 1

the higher of those 2 is the width.
if odd, then that number - 1 / 2 is the middle, both x and y

this number -2 is ALSO the distance rotating blocks need to move around their paths
