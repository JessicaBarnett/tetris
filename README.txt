# GUIDING CONCEPTS

    1. store as little state as possible
    2. don't use prototypes.  stick with plain old objects and use a functional programming approach.
    3. keep arguments simple and consistent
        - uniformly pass a whole board object, and/or a whole block object, to keep things predictable.
    4. handle errors
